\description{
Conduct a two-sample t-test to determine whether survival days differ by treatment.
}
\details{
This function takes a database table of patient data (\code{d}) and separates the number of
survival days by treatment. Then the two resulting groups undergo a two-sample t-test which
will have p<0.05 if their average number of survival days is statistically different.
