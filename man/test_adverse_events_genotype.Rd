\title{Conduct a two-sample t-test to determine whether adverse events differ by genotype.}
\usage{
test_adverse_events_genotype(d)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{A database table containing information about patients, including \code{Genotype} and \code{adverse_events}.}
}
\value{
A t-test showing whether adverse events differ by genotype.

\description{
Conduct a two-sample t-test to determine whether adverse events differ by genotype.
}
\details{
This function takes a database table of patient data (\code{d}) and separates the number of
adverse events by genotype. Then the two resulting groups undergo a two-sample t-test
which will have p<0.05 if their number of adverse events is statistically different.
